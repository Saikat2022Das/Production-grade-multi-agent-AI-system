# Production-Grade Multi-Agent AI System

Build a complete multi-agent AI system that runs entirely on your machine.
No API keys, no cloud dependencies, no ongoing cost.

---

## What this builds

A **Learning Accelerator**: a four-agent system that plans a study curriculum,
explains topics from your own notes, quizzes you, and adapts based on results.
The use case is the teaching vehicle. The architecture is the real subject.

```
Goal: "Learn Python closures and decorators"
  │
  ▼
Curriculum Planner  →  structured study roadmap
  │
  ▼ (you approve the plan)
Explainer           →  reads your notes via MCP, explains each topic
  │
  ▼
Quiz Generator      →  tests understanding, grades answers with LLM-as-judge
  │
  ▼
Progress Coach      →  adapts roadmap, calls CrewAI Study Buddy via A2A
  │
  └── loops back to Explainer for next topic
```

The same architecture pattern runs in production for sales enablement,
compliance training, customer support onboarding, and engineering ramp-up.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | LangGraph 1.1.0 | Stateful agent graph with checkpointing |
| Tool integration | MCP (mcp 1.26.0) | Standardised agent-to-tool protocol |
| Agent coordination | A2A (a2a-sdk 0.3.25) | Cross-framework agent-to-agent protocol |
| Local inference | Ollama | LLM serving at localhost:11434 |
| Cross-framework | CrewAI 1.13.0 | Study Buddy agent (called via A2A) |
| Observability | Langfuse 4.0.1 | Full trace of every agent and LLM call |
| Evaluation | DeepEval 3.9.1 | LLM-as-judge quality metrics |

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a full deep-dive.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running
- Docker Desktop (for Langfuse observability, optional)
- 16 GB RAM minimum, 32 GB recommended
- 8 GB VRAM for `qwen2.5:7b` | 24 GB VRAM for `qwen2.5-coder:32b`

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/Saikat2022Das/Production-grad-multi-agent-AI-System.git
cd multi-agent-ai-system
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Pull your model (choose based on VRAM)
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b          # 8 GB VRAM
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b   # 24 GB VRAM

# 3. Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve                  # in a separate terminal
# Or on macOS: start the Ollama app from your Applications folder

# 4. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set OLLAMA_MODEL to match what you pulled

# 5. Run
python main.py
```

## Running all services

The full system has three processes. Open three terminal tabs.

**Tab 1: Quiz Generator A2A service:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/a2a_services/quiz_service.py
# Serves at http://localhost:9001
```

**Tab 2: CrewAI Study Buddy A2A service:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/crewai_agent/study_buddy.py
# Serves at http://localhost:9002
```

**Tab 3: Main LangGraph application:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

Or use the Makefile:
```bash
make services   # starts both A2A services in background
make run        # runs the main application
```

---

## Session resume

Every session is checkpointed to `data/checkpoints.db` after each agent node.
To resume a stopped session:

```bash
python main.py --resume <session-id>
```

The session ID is printed at the start of every run.

---

## Observability

Start Langfuse locally:
```bash
docker compose up -d
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

Add your API keys to `.env` (from the Langfuse project settings), then run
as normal. Every agent call, LLM completion, and tool call appears in the
trace UI automatically.

---

## Testing

```bash
# Fast unit tests, run during development (~3 seconds)
# 182 tests across 9 test files
pytest tests/ -m "not eval" -v

# Quality evaluation tests, run before releases (~90 seconds, requires Ollama)
# 12 LLM-as-judge tests
pytest tests/test_eval.py -v -s -m eval
```

---

## Adding your own study materials

Replace or add Markdown files in `study_materials/sample_notes/`.
The Explainer agent reads every `.md` file in that directory automatically
via the MCP filesystem server. No configuration changes needed.

---

## Configuration reference

See `.env.example` for all available settings.

Key toggles:
| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:7b` | Model for all agents |
| `USE_A2A_QUIZ` | `true` | Route quiz tasks to A2A service |
| `USE_STUDY_BUDDY` | `true` | Call CrewAI Study Buddy for low scores |
| `CHECKPOINT_DB` | `data/checkpoints.db` | SQLite path for checkpoints |
